Feature: Moon Deletion
  As a user I want to remove moons from the Planetarium so I can correct my findings

  Background: Moon Deletion Starting Actions
    Given that the user is logged in and is on the home page
    And the user deletes a moon

  Scenario: The user should be able to delete an existing moon
    When the user inputs a valid moon name
    When the user presses delete
    Then the user is redirected to the home page
    And the data reflected has been refreshed to include the removed moon(s)

  Scenario Outline: The user should not be able to delete a non-existing planet
    When the user inputs a invalid moon name "<Moon Name>"
    When the user presses delete
    Then the user should get a browser alert saying "Invalid moon name"
    And the user should be redirected to the home page

    Examples:
      |Moon Name    |
      |Random_Moon  |
      |DoesntExist12|
      |TestRemove!!!|
