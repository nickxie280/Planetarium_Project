# Acceptance Testing Requirements

- Is the intended use of the service intuitive?
  - Overall Grade: 3
    - I would say that it does in fact seem quite intuitive. The only thing that I would say is not very intuitive ant that could use improvement is the deletion feature, the box having the placeholder "name for celestial body to be deleted" is a little bit unclear as it implies that you are able to delete both planets and moons, not one or the other. Seeing as you have to select which one you have to delete, it would make more sense for the placeholder to indicate which one you are deleting.
- Is the service easy to use?
  - Overall Grade: 4
    - The ease of use is very apparent. Most of the features are straight-forward and require little to new explanation for execution. It gets the job done in a simple manner and offers not many issues regarding complexity or otherwise difficulty of use.
- Does the service inspire confidence?
  - Overall Grade: 2
    - Having most of the functionalities working is a great starting point. However there are some major issues in regards to some of the requirement that need to be ironed out first before being confident in the product. There are issues spanning small ones like alert typos, to larger and more severe ones like not supporting certain filetypes that impede the user's ability to use the website as a consumer.
- Is the service pleasing to look at?
  - Overall Grade: 3
    - I'd say that the overall formatting of the homepage is very appealing, as the background matches the theme for the functionality of the website. However, the login/registration page could use some improvement as it is bland with no design. The appearance of the login/registration page is very "default" and doesn't offer up much insight for what you are logging into.
